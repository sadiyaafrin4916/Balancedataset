# Balancedataset
Data balancing is crucial when working with imbalanced datasets because most machine learning algorithms assume equal class distribution. Without balancing, the model may become biased toward the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
Randomly remove samples from the majority class until it matches the size of the minority class.
